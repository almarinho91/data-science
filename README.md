# data-science

Personal repository with small data science and machine learning projects I build to practice and learn.

Each folder is a standalone project that covers topics such as data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and deployment.

More projects will be added over time.

- ***fraud-risk-pipeline***:
End-to-end fraud detection project using a public credit card dataset. Includes feature engineering, model training (logistic regression), evaluation with PR-AUC / Precision@K, and a FastAPI service for online risk scoring.
- ***churn-risk***:
Small end-to-end data science project focused on predicting customer churn using a public telecom dataset. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate a realistic data science workflow, from raw data to a trained and evaluated model, including experiment tracking and model interpretation.
